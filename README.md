# Thomas A. R. Purcell Teaching Notebooks
Jupyter Notebooks used in different classes to teach some of the basics of python.

The exact environments that were used for the class are stored as requirement.txt and conda environment yaml files, but most should work with updated python libraries.

Each class has its own folder, will be updated everytime the class is taught by me at the end of the semester
